## To-do list:
### Sure:
- [x] add flat sign
- [x] corresp note number -> correct true note
- [x] upper right basic draw
- [x] flute draw
- [ ] note recognition based on FFT &rarr; threaded?
- [ ] recognized note display
- [ ] automatic note validation

### Maybe:
- [ ] adding register information + draw ?
- [ ] encapsulate in a specific window
- [ ] add tuning setting
- [ ] add visual tuner
